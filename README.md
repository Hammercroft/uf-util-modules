# uf-util-modules
A collection of ROBLOX modules that I made, and could be useful for you.
All modules have licenses embedded in all of them.

- [BurstTransmission](https://github.com/Hammercroft/uf-util-modules/blob/main/BurstTransmission.lua) : Utility for sending timed, high-frequency event bursts over `UnreliableRemoteEvent`
- [M6DRotTransmission](https://github.com/Hammercroft/uf-util-modules/blob/main/M6DRotTransmission.lua) : Utility for efficiently transmitting Motor6D rotation updates from client to server.
